# Meme-Sanskar-Meme-Editing-App-

It took me a lot of time to finally complete it...
So , user will be given two options that from where does he want to upload a image(meme) :
                  1. From our collection (i.e. where you can select memes from the firebase realtime database which would appear in                               cardview)
                  2. From Gallery
Now, editing activity appears where we have options like textview to write something over the image(cause the textview is rezizable and movable all over the activity),seekbar to change color of text, seekbar to change size of text , Download button to save the edited meme in your External Storage

And Hence, my project ends
